# NABTEB-PROJECT
Hey guys, glad we've started working on this! Here's a few things you need to get up and running...as well as a few rules :-)

# Getting Started
1. Install Git. For windows, follow download and install here: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Install Node for windows. Follow instructions here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
3. Download React with npm (node package manager) by running  npm install -g create-react-app --save
4. Clone NABTEB-PROJECT into a local folder
5. Install all dependencies previously installed by running 'npm install'inside NABTEB-PROJECT/FrontEnd/nabteb
6. Run 'npm start' inside project folder stated above.
7. Download Spring Â Tool Suite here https://spring.io/tools/sts/all
8. Download and setup MySql
9. Create a database, user, and password for MySql
10. Edit application.properties in NABTEB-PROJECT/Backend/Nabteb/src/main/resources to match local MySql details
12. Open and run .../Backend/Nabteb with STS or NetBeans

# Rules
1. DO NOT directly update the master branch. 
2. Branch names should contain info about feature being implemented.
3. Methods/Functions should contain 5 to 10 lines of code.
5. Comparisons are to be exact (=== instead of ==).
6. While it is achievable, features should not be implemented with jQuery. If necessary, such code should be imported from a separate file.
7. Reviewed codes should be attended to ASAP as this will aid our progress.
8. The UI is to be predominantly developed using Material UI as shown here: https://www.material-ui.com/#/components/app-bar.
9. Use Bootstrap for Responsiveness.

# Bootstrap, and Material UI are already preinstalled so you do not have to worry about it. 

# Happy Coding!
